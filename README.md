I’ve been asked multiple times by different people to share the list of books I do recommend.

# Leadership

### Culture Code by Daniel Coyle
Lots of fun to read stories about High performant teams. Discusses the ways to build high performant teams.

*"Hello World" in the world of leadership. Great starting point for any person in leadership*

### Turn the Ship Around by L. David Marquet
David has graduated with top marks and got a chance to become a captain of submarine. Book describes 3 stories:

* Small submarine where he applied leader-to-follower approached and scored top evaluations.
* Bigger submarine which was too big to be responsible for everything. He tried to apply Leader-to-Leader approach (inspired by Simon Sinnek and others). But failed.
* Huge submarine that he knows almost nothing about. The submarine and it’s team were a big joke among other submarines. He managed to successfully apply leader-to-leader approach and got brilliant results.

*In my opinion this is the very important book for any leader.*

### Radical Candor 
Kim Scott has worked in Google and Apple with great leaders like Larry Page and Steve Jobs. She shares her great experience, successes and mistakes. 

*This is the best leadership book i've read so far. Contains a lot of great advices and practices. It helped me to discover my mistakes as a leader. I wish I have had read it earlier.*

###  Drive by Dan Pink
This book consists of researches around motivation. Explains why intrinsic motivation is the main source of drive in modern companies.

*Motivation is an important topic for most team. I think all leaders should be aware about it.*

###  Leaders eat Last by Simon Sinnek
Further expansion on the Culture Code. Contains actually scientific background to all the stories in Culture Code. Describes dopamine,serotonin,oxytocin and endorphins hormones and describes how they helped our ancestors to survive and how it could be applied in modern office.

*Much more difficult to read comparing to Culture Code. However, is a great scientific addition to Culture Code. Gave me a lot of useful advices*

### The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni
A very short book contains a novel about a dysfunctional team and the way it was turned around. End of book is list of recommendations to "cure" dysfunctions.

*Very short. The last bit of the book contains a list of actions you can take to solve each dysfunction. I've already came back to listen to it second time*
 
### Dare to Lead by Brene Brown
This book is essentially a big summary of 3 other books written by Brene Brown. She is a legendary woman who has led companies to success. Covers similar topics to Culture Code/Dare to lead but from different angle.

*A lot of dense information. I caught myself constantly reverting 30 seconds back as my mind was still thinking on previous point.*

###  Multipliers
Another leadership book that describes divides leaders to "multipliers" and "diminishers". Discusses differences. Provides a lot of examples 

*Another list of examples of good/bad leaders.*
*Great definition of intelligence as "The ability to see intelligence in other people".*
*In addition has a great example of how person can lead people using questions without any statements*
*However some phrases like "I conducted a research" without any details/statistics of research leaved me uncertain if I can trust the information.*

### It Doesn't Have To Be Crazy At Work by David Heinemeier Hansson and Jason Fried
The book that uses real life example to demonstrate that in order to be productive and succesful you do not have to be stressed and overworked.

*My Takeaways. Ways to kill unnecesary meetings. Advantages of asynchronous communications at work. Will use these techniques in case if I will be expanding my company*

### Summary of leadership books
I believe that this is the order for leadership books:
1. Culture Code
2. Radical Candor
3. Turn the ship around

I do strongly believe that first three books are "starter" pack for each leader

# IT books
### Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps
Scientific researched was conducted on thousands of IT companies. Discusses what metrics used, what outcomes they found. Great summary on how to achieve high performance in team.

*Helps to identify where is your team on the scale of performance. A great guide and a goal to aim for.*
*In case if you listen the book ignore descriptions of charts. It is not very important.*
 
### Project Phoenix by Gene Kim, George Spafford, and Kevin Behr
A novel about devops. Easy to read story about fixing whole IT department.

*Emphasises the importance of Devops movement. In my opinion it contains too little useful information per time to read. However, it's very fun to read.*

### The Goal by Eliyahu M. Goldratt
Nover about real plant that produces parts for customers. A beautiful story that describes how to tackle big problems in pipelines.

*Nothing in this book is about IT apart from the fact that all IT processes are the same processes as in production. We have dependent events and statistical fluctuations.*
*Previously I was tackling performance problems on the level of experience and intuition. Now I have more scientific approach and new ways to tackle problems*

# Personal development

### Difficult Conversations by Bruce Patton, Douglas Stone, and Sheila Heen
Eye opening book for all conversations. Describes the situation and then analyses it from different perspectives and different dimensions: Context, Feelings, Self-identity. Later into the book dives into details of Context/Feelings/Self-Identity.

*If you ask me to name 1 book that has changed my life the most in 8 hours that would be it. Must-read for you and your partner. I have already recommended to most of my friends/family members.*

### Pig Wrestling by Mark Bawden and Pete Lindsay
This book uses memory palace technique to teach you a framework that could be applied to solve "unsolvable" problem

*Authors condensed a lot of tools into short framework and 4 hours of listening audio book. I've listened this book second time. Great book*

### Never Split The Difference by Chris Voss, Tahl Raz
A former FBI hostage negotiator describes neogitation techniques as well as the way to apply them at work

*In my opinion this book is much more interesting than most action movies. Easy to read. Simple advices. Haven't heard about anybody who read and didn't like this book*

### The Life Changing Magic of Not Giving a F**k by Sarah Knight
Most of us have a lot of things to worry about. The book gives direct advices and suggestions how to minimize the things you don’t like/want to do in order to free up time/mental health for the things that actually matter to you.

*Great book that helped to look at some personal stuff from different point of view. I wish I would have applied more often. I have already recommended to most of my friends/family members.*

### Great By Choice by James C. Collins
The book is based on big research of company pairs acting in the same time, same conditions. Some of them died, others prevailed. Authors have made parallels between successful 10x CEOs behaviours.

*Decent book, interesting to read. This book is the most useful to CEO/CTO/Board level. I’d say it’s must read if you plan to run your own business.*

### How to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie
Teaches on how to find the best in every single person and use it into you own advantage.

*I’ve read this book when I was 16 because I wanted to influence people. Instead, this book has taught me see the best in everybody while doing that.*
*When I reread it at ages 22/26 I understood that the book teaches you to like people around you and enjoy the life.*
*I believe that Influence part of the book is a side effect rather than the primary goal.*
*This book had the strongest influence on me as an individual.*
