# What is this page about?
I strongly believe that reading a book is one of the most time effecient ways to consume information.  
The reason for that is authors of books spend years figuring out how to describe information in the most convenient way.

The biggest change in my life happened with the discovery of audiobooks. 
It helped me to transform the most boring time wasters such as commuting to or from work, running on the treadmill at the gym and shopping, into learning!

I have divided the books I am recommending into 3 sections:
* Leadership
* IT Books
* Personal Development

Each section consists of my personal description followed by *my opinion in italic*

# Leadership
### Culture Code by Daniel Coyle
Lots of fun to read stories about highly performant teams and discusses how to build them.

*The "Hello World" in the world of leadership. A great starting point for any person in leadership*

### Turn the Ship Around by L. David Marquet
David has graduated with top marks and got a chance to become a captain of submarine. Book describes 3 stories:

* Small submarine where he applied leader-to-follower approached and scored top evaluations.
* Bigger submarine which was too big to be responsible for everything. He tried to apply Leader-to-Leader approach (inspired by Simon Sinnek and others). But failed.
* Huge submarine that he knows almost nothing about. The submarine and it’s team were a big joke among other submarines. He managed to successfully apply leader-to-leader approach and got brilliant results.

*In my opinion this is the very important book for any leader.*

### Radical Candor by Kim Scott
Kim Scott has worked in both Google and Apple with great leaders like Larry Page and Steve Jobs. She shares her great experiences, successes and mistakes.

*This is the best leadership book I have read so far. It contains a lot of great advice and practices. It helped me to discover many of my mistakes as a leader. I wish I had read it earlier.*

### Drive by Dan Pink
This book consists of researches around motivation. Explains why intrinsic motivation is the main source of drive in modern companies.

*Motivation is an important topic for most teams. I think all leaders should be aware of it.*

### Leaders eat Last by Simon Sinnek
Further expansion on the Culture Code. Contains actually scientific background to all the stories in Culture Code. Describes dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins, how they helped our ancestors to survive, and how it could be applied in the modern office.

*A much more difficult read than the Culture Code. However, it is a great scientific addition and gave me lot of useful advice.*

### The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni
A very short book that contains a story about a dysfunctional team and how it was turned around. At the end of book is a list of recommendations to "cure" dysfunctions.

*Very short. The last bit of the book contains a list of actions you can take to solve each dysfunction. I have already come back to listen to it second time*
 
### Dare to Lead by Brene Brown
This book is essentially a big summary of 3 other books written by Brene Brown. She is a legendary woman who has led many companies to success. It covers similar topics to Culture Code but from a different angle.

*A lot of dense information. I caught myself constantly jumping 30 seconds back as my mind was still digesting a previous point.*

###  Multipliers
Another leadership book that describes divides leaders to "multipliers" and "diminishers". Discusses differences. Provides a lot of examples 

*Another list of examples of good/bad leaders.*
*Great definition of intelligence as "The ability to see intelligence in other people".*
*In addition has a great example of how person can lead people using questions without any statements*
*However some phrases like "I conducted a research" without any details/statistics of research leaved me uncertain if I can trust the information.*

### It Doesn't Have To Be Crazy At Work by David Heinemeier Hansson and Jason Fried
The book that uses real life example to demonstrate that in order to be productive and succesful you do not have to be stressed and overworked.

*My Takeaways. Ways to kill unnecesary meetings. Advantages of asynchronous communications at work. Will use these techniques in case if I will be expanding my company*

### Summary of leadership books
I believe that this is the order for leadership books:
1. Culture Code
2. Radical Candor
3. Turn the ship around

I do strongly believe that first three books are "starter" pack for each leader

# IT Books
### Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps
Scientific researched was conducted on thousands of IT companies. Discusses what metrics used, what outcomes they found. Great summary on how to achieve high performance in team.

*Helps to identify where is your team on the scale of performance. A great guide and a goal to aim for.*
*In case if you listen the book ignore descriptions of charts. It is not very important.*
 
### Project Phoenix by Gene Kim, George Spafford, and Kevin Behr
A novel about DevOps. An easy to read story about fixing a whole IT department.

*Emphasises the importance of the DevOps movement. In my opinion it contains not enough useful information given how long it takes to read. That said, it is a very enjoyable book.*

### The Goal by Eliyahu M. Goldratt
A novel about a real factory that produces parts for customers. It's a beautiful story that describes how to tackle big problems in pipelines.

*Nothing in this book is about IT apart from the fact that all IT processes are the same processes as in production. We have dependent events and statistical fluctuations.*
*Previously I was tackling performance problems on the level of experience and intuition. Now I have a more scientific approach and new ways to tackle problems*

# Personal Development
### Difficult Conversations by Bruce Patton, Douglas Stone, and Sheila Heen
An eye opening book for all conversations. Describes the situation and then analyses it from different perspectives. Later in the book, it dives into the details of context, feelings and self-identity.

*If you would ask me to name one book that has changed my life the most in 8 hours, this would be it. A must-read for you and your partner. I have already recommended to most of my friends and family members.*

### Pig Wrestling by Mark Bawden and Pete Lindsay
This book uses the memory palace technique to teach you a framework that could be applied to solve "unsolvable" problems.

*The authors have condensed a lot of tools into a small framework that is only a 4 hour listen as an audiobook. I've listened this book several times. Great book.*

### Never Split The Difference by Chris Voss, Tahl Raz
A former FBI hostage negotiator describes neogitation techniques as well as the way to apply them at work.

*In my opinion this book is far more interesting than most action movies. It's easy to read and has simple advice. I haven't heard about anybody who has read this book and didn't like it.*

### The Life Changing Magic of Not Giving a F**k by Sarah Knight
Most of us have a lot of things to worry about. This book gives direct advice and suggestions on how to minimize the things you don’t like or want to do in order to free up time and mental energy for the things that actually matter to you.

*A great book that helped me to look at some personal challenges from a different point of view. I wish I had applied its lessons more often. I have already recommended to most of my friends and family members.*

### Great By Choice by James C. Collins
The book is based on research that analysed pairs of companies, acting at the same time with the same conditions. Some of them died, others prevailed. The authors have drawn parallels between successful 10x CEO behaviours.

*A decent book that is interesting to read. This book is the most useful to those at the CEO/CTO/Board level. I think it is a must read if you plan to run your own business.*

### How to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie
Teaches you how to find the best in everyone and then use it to your own advantage.

*This book has had the strongest influence on me as an individual. I read this book when I was 16 because I wanted to influence people. Instead, this book taught me see the best in everybody. When I re-read it at ages 22 and 26, I learned that the book teaches you to like people around you and enjoy the life.*
*I believe that the "influence" part of the book is a side effect of learning to see the good in everyone and acting from a position of good faith.*
