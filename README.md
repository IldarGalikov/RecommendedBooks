Iâ€™ve been asked multiple times by different people to share the list of books I do recommend.

# Leadership

###  Culture Code By Daniel Coyle
Lots of fun to read stories about High performant teams. Discusses the ways to build high performant teams.

*"Hello World" in the world of leadership. Great starting point for any person in leadership*

###  Turn the Ship Around - the submarine captain David Marquet
David has graduated with top marks and got a chance to become a captain of submarine. Book goes through 3 stories.

* Small submarine where he applied leader-to-follower approached and scored top evaluations.
* Bigger submarine which was too big to be responsible for everything. He tried to apply Leader-to-Leader approach (inspired by Simon Sinnek and others). But failed.
* Huge submarine that he know almost nothing about. The submarine and itâ€™s team was a big joke among other submarines. He managed to successfully apply leader-to-leader approach and got brilliant results.

*In my opinion this is extremely important book for any leader. It empathised.*

###  Radical Candor 
The book is written by author who worked in Google and Apple with great leaders like Larry Page and Steve Jobs. Contains 

*Probably the best leadership book. Contains a lot of great advices and practices. It helped me to discover my mistakes as a leader. When I finished reading the only thing is I wished I read it earlier.*

###  Drive by Dan Pink
This book consists of researches around motivation. Explains why intrinsic motivation is the main source of drive in modern companies.

*This book is inderectly related ot leadership. However motivation of people is one of deciding factors for productivity in teams. I think all leaders should be aware about it.*

###  Leaders eat Last by Simon Sinnek
Further expansion on the Culture Code. Contains actually scientific background to all the stories in Culture Code. Discusses Dopamine, Serotonin, Oxytocin, etc. hormones and describes how it helped our ancestors to survive and how it could be applied in modern office.

*Quite dull comparing to Culture Code. However served as an addon for Culture Code. Had lots of useful advices*

### The Five Dysfunctions of a Team by Patrick Lencioni
A very short book contains a novel about a dysfunctional team and the way it was turned around. End of book is list of recommendations to "cure" dysfunctions.

*Very short. The last bit of the book contains a list of actions you can take to solve each dysfunction. I've already came back to listen to it second time*
 
###  Dare to Lead by Brene Brown
This book is essentially a big summary of 3 other books written by Brene Brown. She is a legendary woman who has lead companies to success. Covers similar topics to Culture Code/Dare to lead but from different angle.

*A lot of dense information. I caught myself constantly reverting 30 seconds back as my mind was still thinking on previous point. David Carboni called Culture Code, Leaders eat Last and Dare to lead as a trilogy introduction into leadership. I tend to agree. However itâ€™s pretty big time investment.*

###  Multipliers
leadership book that descibes leaders as either "multipliers" or "deminishers". Discusses differences. A lot fo examples 

 
*Another list of examples of good/bad leaders.* 
*Great definition of intelligence as "The ability to see intelligence in other people".* 
*In addition has a great example of how person can lead people using questions without any statements*
*However some phrases like "I conducted a research" without any details/statistics of research leaved me uncertain if I can trust the information.*


### Summary of leadership books
I believe that this is the order for leadership books:
1. Culture Code
2. Radical Candor
3. Turn the ship around

I do strongly believe that first three books are "starter" pack for each leader

# IT books
### Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps
Scientific researched was conducted on thousands of IT companies. Discusses what metrics used, what outcomes they found. Great summary on how to achieve high performance in team.

* Helps to identify where is your team on the scale of performance. A great guide and goal to aim for.*
*In case if you listen the book ignore descriptions of charts. It is not very important.
 
### Project Phoenix by Gene Kim, George Spafford, and Kevin Behr
A novel about devops. Easy to read story about fixing whole IT department.

*Emphasises the importence of Devops movement. In my opinion it contains too little useful information per time to read. However it's extreemely interesting and fun to read.* 

#Personal development

### Difficult Conversations by Bruce Patton, Douglas Stone, and Sheila Heen
Eye opening book for all conversations. Describes the situation and then analyses it from different perspectives and different dimensions : Context, Feelings, Self-identity. Later into the book dives into details of Context/Feelings/Self-Identity.

*If you ask me to name 1 book that has changed my life the most in 8 hours that would be it. Must read for you, you partner and your children when they grow up ðŸ˜Š I have already recommended to most of my friends/family members.*


### The Life Changing Magic of Not Giving a F**k by Sarah Knight
Most of us have a lot of things to worry about. The book gives direct advices and suggestions how to minimize the things you donâ€™t like/want to do in order to free up time/mental health for the things that actually matter to you.

*Great book that helped to look at some personal stuff from different point of view. I wish I would have applied more often. I have already recommended to most of my friends/family members.*


### Great By Choice by James C. Collins
The book is based on big research of company pairs acting in the same time, same conditions. Some of them died, others prevailed. Authors have made parallels between successful (10xer) CEOs behaviours.

*Decent book, interesting to read. This book is the most useful to CEO/CTO/Board level. Iâ€™d say itâ€™s must read if you plan to run your own business.*


### How to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie
Teaches on how to find the best in every single person and use it into you own advantage.

*Iâ€™ve read this book when I was 16 because I wanted to influence people. It changed me find the best in everybody while doing that. When I reread it at ages 22/26 I understood that the book teaches you to like people around you and enjoy the life. I think that Influence part of the book is a side-effect rather than the primary goal.
This book had the strongest influence on me as a character. Iâ€™ve made almost every single family person to read it. Nobody was disappointed.*
